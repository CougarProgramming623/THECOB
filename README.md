# The Cougar Optic Board

## About
The Cougar Optic Board (or The COB) is an interactable user interface for drivers competing in FIRST Robotics Competitions. It was developed by Team 623 for the 2018 game, FIRST Power Up. It is open source for any team to use.

## Running
Simply run `COB.bat` to launch both the FRC Driver Station and the COB. Both should connect automatically, but if not, try the following ip addresses: <br /> <br />
`10.6.23.2` (with your team number) <br />
`RoboRIO-623-FRC.local` (with your team number) <br /> <br />
If these don't work, check your Driver Station for the IP address of the dashboard.
